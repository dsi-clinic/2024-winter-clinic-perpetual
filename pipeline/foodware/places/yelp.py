        """Locates all POIs with a review within the given geography.
        The Fusion API permits searching for POIs within a radius around
        a given point. Therefore, data is extracted by dividing the
        geography's bounding box into cells of equal size and then searching
        within the circular areas that circumscribe (i.e., perfectly enclose)
        those cells.

        To circumscribe a cell, the circle must have a radius that is
        one-half the length of the cell's diagonal (as derived from the
        Pythagorean Theorem). Let `side` equal the length of a cell's side.
        It follows that the radius is:

        ```
        radius = (√2/2) * side
        ```

        Yelp sets a cap on the radius search size, so after solving for `side`,
        it follows that cell sizes are restricted as follows:

        ```
        max_side = √2 * max_radius
        ```

        Therefore, the bounding box must be split into _at least_ the following
        number of cells along the x- and y- (i.e., longitude and latitude)
        directions to avoid having cells that are too big:

        ```
        min_num_splits = ceil(bounding_box_length / max_side)
        ```

        Finally, only 1,000 records may be fetched from a single query, with
        a maximum limit of 50 records per page of data, even if more businesses
        are available. Therefore, it is important to confirm that less than
        1,000 records are returned with a query to avoid missing data.
